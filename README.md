8-1 Journal: Portfolio Submission

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

Answer: When looking at Project One’s problems, that I set to solve, was evaluating the different data structures run-times and particular efficiency determining the weaknesses and overall strengths of each data structure. As for Project Two I set out to create a functioning program that could properly print a list of courses that were in alphanumeric order.

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

Answer: Understanding the different data structures is important as it can help to determine which particular structure will be best for whatever particular project you're working on. Project One’s focus was understanding the difference between different data structures in order to complete it. Then for Project Two I used what I learned about the efficiencies of different data structures to choose the best one in order to proceed and complete Project Two.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Answer: Typically the biggest roadblocks I tend to come across when it comes to any coding project is debugging. And in this case it was no different, by a certain point I used services beyond Zybook such as Stack Overflow where I could get more specific help for any issues I was having on my Project. 

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

Answer: These projects went a long way in expanding my overall knowledge of data structures, which I hope to apply in using for other projects in the future, when necessary.

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

Answer: I find that after any coding course, I always learn how to write code more effectively and efficiently and this course was no different. The work in this course pushed me to write code that is more clean and easily modifiable by others. Overall, the goal moving forward is writing code that can be easily updated by myself and others. This will be necessary when working on more team-based projects where multiple people will be looking at and even modifying the same pieces of code.
